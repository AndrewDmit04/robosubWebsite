                <p>
                    RoboSub is an international robotics competition that challenges 
                    student teams to design, build, and program autonomous underwater 
                    vehicles (AUVs) capable of completing complex tasks in a simulated 
                    maritime environment. Hosted annually by the RoboNation organization, 
                    the competition aims to advance the field of underwater robotics while 
                    fostering innovation, collaboration, and hands-on learning among students. 
                    Teams must navigate their AUVs through a series of underwater obstacles and tasks, 
                    such as passing through gates, manipulating objects, and firing torpedoes, all while 
                    operating autonomously without human intervention.
